Simple plugin to scan "uploads" directory and bring those files into Media Library.

== Description ==

You can scan all files that are in "uploads" directory and see which ones are actually in Media Library and which ones are just sitting there. Then you can select those that you want to import to database and therefore make them available in Media Library.

You can also use FTP to upload your files to "uploads" directory and use this plugin to bring those files into Media Library. There are other plugins that can be used for that, but with this one you can easily select all and import all at once.


= Why I created this plugin =
I once copied WordPress site to a different server and Media Library ended up being empty, even tho all files were in "uploads" directory and database was copied. So I had to use some other plugin which required me to manually enter each directory and import files in batches per each directory. But I needed something to just import everything at once, so I created this plugin.

Files that are ignored:
- index.php,
- various hidden files,
- WP generated thumbnails - anything ending with for example -100x100.jpg.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `media-sync` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: Stuck at importing / spins endlessly
A: Please try to increase `max_execution_time` in `php.ini` on server (as described [here](https://thimpress.com/knowledge-base/how-to-increase-maximum-execution-time-for-wordpress-site/)).
